# ðŸŽ¨ Creating your own UI

If `CameraAwesomeBuilder.awesome()` doesn't fit your needs in terms of layout, you can create your own UI using the `CameraAwesomeBuilder.custom()` constructor.

The camera preview will be visible behind what you will provide to this builder.

```dart
CameraAwesomeBuilder.custom(
  saveConfig: SaveConfig.photoAndVideo(),
  builder: (cameraState, previewSize, previewRect) {
    // Return your UI (a Widget)
    return cameraState.when(
      onPreparingCamera: (state) => const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()),
      onPhotoMode: (state) => TakePhotoUI(state),
      onVideoMode: (state) => RecordVideoUI(state, recording: false),
      onVideoRecordingMode: (state) => RecordVideoUI(state, recording: true),
    );
  },
)
```

You can find more examples on the `example` folder.

## Builder method

The `builder` method is the main method here.

```dart
typedef CameraLayoutBuilder = Widget Function(CameraState cameraModeState, PreviewSize previewSize, Rect previewRect);
```

CamerAwesome works using a state pattern to make sure you can only call methods available on the current camera state.
The magic is that you don't have to do anything apart calling some methods using the camera state.

```dart
state.when(
    onAnalysisOnlyMode: (analysisCameraState) => analysisCameraState.startAnalysis(),
    onPhotoMode: (photoCameraState) => photoCameraState.takePhoto(),
    onVideoMode: (videoCameraState) => videoCameraState.startRecording(),
    onVideoRecordingMode: (videoRecordingCameraState) => videoRecordingCameraState.stopRecording(),
    onPreparingCamera: (preparingCameraState) => Loader(),
    onPreviewMode: (previewCameraState) => previewModeState.focus(),
);
```

`previewSize` and `previewRect` are additional parameters that might be used to position your UI around or on top of the camera preview.

### CamerAwesome has 6 different states

- **PreparingCameraState** : camera is starting
- **PhotoCameraState** : camera is ready to take a photo
- **VideoCameraState** : camera is ready to take a video
- **VideoRecordingCameraState** : camera is taking a video
- **PreviewCameraState** : camera is in preview only mode
- **AnalysisCameraState** : camera is in analysis only mode

Here is a schema showing the interactions between states:
![Camera states interactions](/img/camera_states_interactions.png)

As you can see, after the initial `PreparingCameraState`, the new state is either `PhotoCameraState` or `VideoCameraState`.
A `VideoRecordingCameraState` replaces the `VideoCameraState` when a recording starts. You can't start two recording at the same time thanks to this.
When the recording stops, a `VideoCameraState` replaces it again.

### You don't have to worry about state management here

`CameraAwesomeBuilder` calls the `builder` method each time you switch between camera states.
This way, you can react to these changes easily in your `builder` ðŸ‘Œ

## Creating my own widget

`CameraState` lets you build a reactive UI by providing you streams and setters to the various properties around the camera.
It should let you create everything you need in a reactive way without worrying about the camera flow.

You can get inspiration on how we built every widgets.

**Example**

```dart
class AwesomeFlashButton extends StatelessWidget {
  final CameraState state;

  const AwesomeFlashButton({
    super.key,
    required this.state,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StreamBuilder<SensorConfig>(
      // Listen to the current SensorConfig. It might change when switching between front and back cameras.
      stream: state.sensorConfig$,
      builder: (_, sensorConfigSnapshot) {
        if (!sensorConfigSnapshot.hasData) {
          return const SizedBox.shrink();
        }
        final sensorConfig = sensorConfigSnapshot.requireData;
        return StreamBuilder<FlashMode>(
          // Listen to the currently selected flash mode
          stream: sensorConfig.flashMode$,
          builder: (context, snapshot) {
            if (!snapshot.hasData) {
              return Container();
            }
            return _FlashButton.from(
              // Build your button differently based on the current Flash mode, with different icons for instance
              flashMode: snapshot.requireData,
              onTap: () => sensorConfig.switchCameraFlash(),
            );
          },
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In the snippet above, the widget first listens to `CameraState.sensorConfig$` to get the most up-to-date `SensorConfig`. It might change when switching between back and front camera for instance.

Once you have your `SensorConfig`, you can listen to their properties like the flash mode.

Since we want to listen to its changes, we use `flashMode$`, which is a `Stream` of the current flash mode.

> ðŸ‘Œ Every getter terminated with the $ are streams in CamerAwesome.
>
> The equivalent without $ is the current value. You should not store these in variables since they may change over time.

## Using provided widgets

You can find common widgets that you may want to use in the **Widgets** section.

Many of them use the `AwesomeTheme` provided to `CameraAwesomeBuilder`.
Feel free to customize it and reuse this theme in your own UI.
See the [theme](/theme) section for more details.

Instead of handling it yourself, using the built-in widgets can let you rotate your buttons automatically when the phone rotates with [AwesomeOrientedWidget](/widgets/awesome_oriented_widget) for instance.

Check also built-in [buttons](/widgets/buttons) and the [camera mode selector](/widgets/camera_mode_selector).

## Setting and reading camera properties

If you need more customization, you can find details on how to access and update the properties of the camera below.

Note that we recommend to access properties via their `Stream` whenever possible.
If you need it to build your UI, just use it with a `StreamBuilder`.

### Camera sensor properties and methods

`CameraState` gives access to the current `SensorConfig` (via a Stream or a getter).
You will use this object to get or set different sensor related properties.

See the tables below for each use case.
