## üìñ Installation

### Add the package in your pubspec.yaml

```yaml
dependencies:
    camerawesome: ^2.0.0
    ...
```

**Please check the last version on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/camerawesome)**

### ‚úîÔ∏è Platform specific setup

#### iOS Setup

Add these permissions on `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Your own description</string>

<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>To enable microphone access when recording video</string>

<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>To enable GPS location access for Exif data</string>
```

#### Android Setup

Change the minimum SDK version to 21 (or higher) in `android/app/build.gradle`

```
minSdkVersion 21
```

In order to be able to take pictures or record videos, you may need additional permissions depending on the Android version and where you want to save them.
Read more about it in the [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage).

> `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` is not included in the plugin starting with version 1.4.0.

To record videos with audio, add this permission to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourpackage">
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />

    <!-- Other declarations -->
</manifest>
```

You may also want to save location of your pictures in exif metadata. In this case, add below permissions:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.yourpackage">
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />

    <!-- Other declarations -->
</manifest>
```

<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è Overriding Android dependencies</summary>

Some of the dependencies used by CamerAwesome can be overriden if you have a conflict.
Change these variables to define which version you want to use:

```gradle
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.7.10'
    ext {
        // You can override these variables
        compileSdkVersion = 33
        minSdkVersion = 24 // 21 minimum
        playServicesLocationVersion = "20.0.0"
        exifInterfaceVersion = "1.3.4"
    }
    // ...
}
```

Only change these variables if you are sure of what you are doing.

For example, setting the Play Services Location version might help you when you have conflicts with other plugins.
The below line shows an example of these conflicts:

```
java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError: Found interface com.google.android.gms.location.ActivityRecognitionClient, but class was expected
```
