# üì∑ üì∑ Multiple cameras at once (üöß BETA)

To enable concurrent cameras feature, you need to give `CameraAwesomeBuilder` a `SensorConfig` with multiple sensors:

```dart
CameraAwesomeBuilder.awesome(
    // 1.
    sensorConfig: SensorConfig.multiple(
        // 2.
        sensors: [
            Sensor.position(SensorPosition.back),
            Sensor.position(SensorPosition.front),
        ],
        // 3.
        flashMode: FlashMode.auto,
        aspectRatio: CameraAspectRatios.ratio_16_9,
    ),
    // Other params
)
```

The main points of interest are the following:

1. Instead of using the `SensorConfig.single` constructor, use `SensorConfig.multiple`.
2. This constructor lets you define a list of sensors instead of a single one.
3. Then, you can set regular sensor parameters like `flashMode` or `aspectRatio`.

## Feature support

Not all devices support the concurrent cameras feature. Keep in mind that it can be resource intensive.

Check the following method to determine if the feature is supported on the current device:

```dart
final isSupported = await CamerawesomePlugin.isMultiCamSupported()
```

## Customizing the picture-in-picture preview

The `pictureInPictureConfigBuilder` parameter lets you customize the preview of the additional sensors.

A `PictureInPictureConfigBuilder` is a function that is called with the index of the sensor and the sensor itself as parameters and returns a `PictureInPictureConfig` object.

Here is a sample code taken from the `multi_camera.dart` example:

```dart
CameraAwesomeBuilder.awesome(
 pictureInPictureConfigBuilder: (index, sensor) {
      const width = 200.0;
      return PictureInPictureConfig(
        // 1.
        isDraggable: false,
        // 2.
        startingPosition: Offset(
          screenSize.width - width - 20.0 * index,
          screenSize.height - 356,
        ),
        // 3.
        sensor: sensor,
        // 4.
        onTap: (){
          print('on preview tap');
        },
        // 5.
        pictureInPictureBuilder: (preview, aspectRatio) {
          return SizedBox(
            width: width,
            height: width,
            child: ClipPath(
              clipper: _MyCustomPipClipper(
                width: width,
                height: width * aspectRatio,
                shape: shape,
              ),
              child: SizedBox(
                width: width,
                // 6.
                child: preview,
              ),
            ),
          );
        },
      );
    },
)
```

Let's break it down:

1. Define if you want the preview to be draggable or not using the `isDraggable` parameter.
2. Choose the `startingPosition` of the preview. You may adjust it depending on the index of the sensor.
3. Set for which `sensor` this preview is.
4. Add an `onTap` callback.
5. Customize how you want the preview to be displayed using the `pictureInPictureBuilder`. This builder must display the `preview` widget. You may also use the `aspectRatio` of the preview to adjust the size of the widget.

## Get the list of sensors

You can get the list of all the sensors available on iOS with:

```dart
final sensorDeviceData = await CamerawesomePlugin.getSensors();
```

## Maximum number of concurrent cameras

Although the code lets you define any number of sensors, each platform has its limits regarding the number of cameras you can open simultaneously.

| Platform | Max number of cameras |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| Android  | 2                     |
| iOS      | 3                     |

Providing more cameras may result in unexpected behaviour.


## Capturing multiple pictures

You can capture multiple pictures at once with the regular `takePhoto()` method:

```dart
await photoCameraState.takePhoto();
```

Then, listen to `cameraState.captureState$` in order to retrieve the last medias captured.

A `MediaCapture` object contains a `CaptureRequest` which might be either a `SingleCaptureRequest` or a `MultipleCaptureRequest`, depending on the number of sensors used.

You can use the `when` operator to deal with this or directly cast it to one of the mentionned classes.

Here is an example which handles the preview tap:

```dart
CameraAwesomeBuilder.awesome(
    ...
    onMediaTap: (mediaCapture) {
        mediaCapture.captureRequest.when(
        // 1.
        single: (single) => OpenFile.open(single.file?.path),
        // 2.
        multiple: (multiple) => Navigator.of(context).pushNamed(
                '/gallery',
                arguments: multiple,
            ),
        );
    },
)
```
In this example, we use the `when` operator to handle each case:
1. If it's a `SingleCaptureRequest`, we open the file directly.
2. If it's a `MultipleCaptureRequest`, we navigate to a new page and pass the `MultipleCaptureRequest` object as an argument. This page could be used to display all the pictures taken for instance.



## Capturing multiple videos

Concurrent camera video recording support is not ready yet.


## Limitations

### Sensor settings

Sensor settinigs like `flashMode` or `aspectRatio` are only applied to the first sensor in the list (let's call it the main sensor).

### Sensors used on Android

The sensors used are not necessarly the ones given in the list of sensors.

There is a concept of pairs of concurrent cameras on this platform which implies that only some specific pairs will be compatible with each other.

For now, the sensors used are always one from the front and one from the back of the device.

### Analysis mode with concurrent cameras

This feature is not ready yet and might not be as good as you would expect: it would require even more resources.

### Differences between pictures taken and Preview

The preview shows the additional sensors as picture-in-picture.

This is not what is captured by CamerAwesome: instead, a picture for each sensor is individually captured.

For now, you are responsible to merge them into one picture (or use a `Widget` to position each image as you want).
