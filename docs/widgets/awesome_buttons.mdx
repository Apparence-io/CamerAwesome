## Built-in Buttons

You may want different icons, additional features or just arrange the screen differently.
In this case, you will use `CameraAwesomeBuilder.custom()` instead of `CameraAwesomeBuiilder.awesome()`.

Yet, if some of our buttons suit your needs, feel free to use them!


### AwesomeMediaPreview

Shows a clickable preview of a media captured using CamerAwesome.

_This widget rotates when the camera rotates._

Below example shows how to show the last captured media using `AwesomeMediaPreview`.

``` dart
StreamBuilder<MediaCapture?>(
  stream: state.captureState$,
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    if (!snapshot.hasData) {
      return Container(width: 72, height: 72);
    }
    return SizedBox(
      width: 72,
      child: AwesomeMediaPreview(
        mediaCapture: snapshot.requireData,
        onMediaTap: onMediaTap,
      ),
    );
  },
)
```

Note: video preview is not implemented in this widget since it would imply a dependency to other packages.


You can find an alternative widget that auto plays the last video recorded in the `example` project at `widgets/custom_media_preview.dart`.

It uses the `video_player` package under the hood.

See its usage in `custom_ui_example_3.dart`.
