You can customize the look and feel of CamerAwesome's built-in widgets by setting your own theme.

It can be used both in `CameraAwesomeBuilder.awesome()` and `CameraAwesomeBuilder.custom()` constructors.

Included buttons (Flash button, aspect ratio...) are black with a white icon and they bounce when you tap them.

You can completely change them if you set a new `AwesomeTheme`:

Example:

```dart
CameraAwesomeBuilder.awesome(
  theme: AwesomeTheme(
    // Background color of the bottom actions
    bottomActionsBackgroundColor: Colors.deepPurple.withOpacity(0.5),
    // Buttons theme
    buttonTheme: AwesomeButtonTheme(
      // Background color of the button
      backgroundColor: Colors.deepPurple.withOpacity(0.5),
      // Size of the icon
      iconSize: 32,
      // Padding around the icon
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(18),
      // Color of the icon
      foregroundColor: Colors.lightBlue,
      // Tap visual feedback (ripple, bounce...)
      buttonBuilder: (child, onTap) {
        return ClipOval(
          child: Material(
            color: Colors.transparent,
            shape: const CircleBorder(),
            child: InkWell(
              splashColor: Colors.deepPurple,
              highlightColor: Colors.deepPurpleAccent.withOpacity(0.5),
              onTap: onTap,
              child: child,
            ),
          ),
        );
      },
    ),
  ),
);
```

![Custom theme](/img/custom_theme.gif)

Let's see what happens in the above animation:
- In the first part, the default theme of CamerAwesome is used. Note that the Flash button bounces when tapped.
- Then, the code is changed to show the custom theme above with a hot reload.
- Finally, the UI is updated with the new purple theme and you can see that even the Flash button has a different tap effect: it is now a ripple.

If you are using the built-in widgets - even partially, it is recommended to use `AwesomeTheme` in the rest of your Camera UI to stay consistent.

You can access the current `AwesomeTheme` by using `AwesomeThemeProvider`:

```dart
final myTheme = AwesomeThemeProvider.of(context).theme
```

**Tips:**
- If you don't have a `BuildContext` to access the parent's `AwesomeTheme`, wrap your widget within a `Builder` widget.
- Use `AwesomeTheme.copyWith()` to make a copy of an `AwesomeTheme` and change only the properties you want to change. The same goes for `AwesomeButtonTheme`.

See `custom_theme.dart` for an example with a custom theme.
